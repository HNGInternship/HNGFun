							<p class="text-justify">Anyone who knows design will understand Figma's commitment to play David against the Goliath behemoths that have existed for decades and built billion-dollar businesses. Whether Figma will survive is not the issue, it is how well the competition responds to the threat of Figma.</p>
							<p class="text-justify">In essence, Figma is a browser-based Photoshop, but rather than overload on redundant tools, it encourages interaction design. Every change is tracked and recorded to the cloud (which is how we do things today) and version control ensures we can rewind a project to previous states</p>
							<p class="text-justify">So the solo software experience that UI work was touted and nurtured to be is rapidly becoming a thing of the past, time is being saved and creativity is on the rise.</p>
